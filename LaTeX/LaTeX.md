# $\LaTeX$

[TOC]

## Overview

$\LaTeX​$ is a text editor, which uses a simple scripting language to help in writing research papers and reports, which produces documents which are beautifully formatted. It also has various amount of packages to help with various features one might want to add to their report, such as an equation editor and a citation manager.

## Getting Started

To get started, one should download [MiKT~E~X](https://miktex.org/), an open source implementation of $\LaTeX$, which also installs TeXworks, an editor for your T~E~X documents(though I personally prefer to use T~E~Xstudio). MiKT~E~X will also act as a package manager for the additional packages which you may download.

## First Document in $\LaTeX$

After opening MiKTeX, copy and paste the following into the editor

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
	hello world
\end{document}
```

`\documentclass{}` indicates the type of document which is intended to be used, more details can be found below in the [Document Classes](#document-classes) section.

`\begin{}` is used as a header for each section, and the type of section which you are beginning will be entered into the curly brackets. The section will then be closed by a similar `\end{}`, to close off the section. `\begin{}` and  `\end{}` would be used regularly to begin other sections, such as other subsections and equations.

## Basics of $\LaTeX$

### Document classes

There are several document classes in $\LaTeX​$ which can be chosen from and used as an argument for the `\documentclass{}` command. These will affect how your document is organized, such as in the manner in which the sections are formatted, and whether a title page is generated by default. Below is a table of the various document types.

| Document class name | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `article`           | For articles to be published in scientific journals and short reports, but can be used as a general purpose document type |
| `book`              | For books                                                    |
| `report`            | For longer reports with support for formatting multiple parts and chapters. |

There are also modifiers and options which can be used with the `\documentclass[]{}` command, and placed in the square brackets if needed. The modifiers are available as follows.

| Options                                                      | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `10pt, 11pt, 12pt`                                           | Sets the font size for the main text of the document         |
| `a4paper, a5paper, b5paper, legalpaper, executivepaper, letterpaper` | Sets the paper size for the document                         |
| `twocolumn`                                                  | Sets the text to be written in two columns instead of one main block |
| `oneside, twoside`                                           | Sets whether the document was intended to be printed on one side or two sides |
| ```titlepage```                                              | Set title of document to be on a page of its own             |

### Sectioning



### Inserting comments

Comments can be added by adding the `%` sign to the start of the line you wish to comment.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
	% This is a comment.
	This is not a comment.
\end{document}
```

### Superscript and Subscript

Superscripts and subscripts can be added via the use of `^` and  `_` in your terms. It can be combined with `{}` to superscript and subscript multiple characters at the same time.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
	You can superscript a single character^a, or multiple characters like^{this}.
	The same works for subscript_s in single character, and multiple character_{form}
\end{document}
```



## Math Equations

Math equations can be embedded into sentences by embedding it within `$`

```latex
This is how $1+1=2$ you embed equations.
```

### `amsmath` package

The `amsmath` package is a commonly used package for inserting equations and aligning them as well. An example on how to use it as below

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
	
	\begin{equation}
		1+2=3
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation*}
		1+2=3
	\end{equation*}
	
	\begin{align}
		1+2 &= 3\\
		3 &= 1+2
	\end{align}
	
	\begin{gather}
		2+2 = 4\\
		4-1 = 3\\
	\end{gather}
	
\end{document}
```

These are not all of the of the methods to display equations in `amsmath`, but would suffice for most use cases. Adding `*` at the end of the arguement would result in the equations not being numbered.

## Bibliography

Citation in $\LaTeX$ is easy, and one of the main reasons which I like to use $\LaTeX$.

### `bibLaTeX` package

bib$\LaTeX$ is the package which we will use for our citation in $\LaTeX$.

### Storing your references

Instead of storing your reference data within the document, Bib$\LaTeX$ gets your references from a `.bib` file. `.bib` files can be generated from referencing software such as Zotero, or in the case in which you wish to produce your own(not recommended), you use the below as a sample.

```bibtex
@BOOK{book:1,
AUTHOR="Name of Author",
TITLE="Title of Book",
PUBLISHER="Publisher of Book",
Year="2000",
}
```

### Referencing Bib$\LaTeX$

Bib$\LaTeX$ uses the standard .bib file, and can use the Biber and bibTex backend. In this tutorial, we will be covering the use of the biber backend. Sample code below:

```latex
\documentclass{report}
\usepackage{biblatex}
\addbibresource{My Library.bib}

\begin{document}
	I want to cite this\autocite{book:1}
	\printbibliography
\end{document}
```

When compiling this, you want to run the following in order

1. $\LaTeX$

2. Biber

3. $\LaTeX$

To specify the citation style which you intend to use, you can modify the `\usepackage{biblatex}` line, to `\usepackage[style=stylename]{biblatex}`. The available styles are as follows:

| stylename      | Style                                                        |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| apa            | American Psychological Association                           |
| bwl-FU         | Busi­ness Ad­min­is­tra­tion Depart­ment of the Free Univer­sity of Ber­lin |
| chem-acs       | American Chemical Society                                    |
| chem-angew     | Angewandte Chemie International                              |
| chem-biochem   |                                                              |
| chem-rsc       |                                                              |
| ieee           | The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) |
| mla            | Modern Language Association                                  |
| musuos         |                                                              |
| nature         |                                                              |
| nejm           |                                                              |
| phys           | American Physical Society                                    |
| science        |                                                              |
| geschichtsfrkl | His­tory Fac­ulty of the Univer­sity of Freiburg (Ger­many)  |
| oscola         |                                                              |

Note that the above styles are not the default styles which are included with $\LaTeX$, and as such their respective packages would have to be installed.

## Formatting

### Dummy text (`blindtext`)

If you want to just do up a template when the content has not been finalized, you can use the `blindtext` package, to generate the lipsum dummy text.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{blindtext}

\begin{document}
	\blindtext
\end{document}
```



### `parskip` (Spacing between Paragraphs)

The `parskip` package is one of the simplest ones to use. Simply just add the package to your file, and leave a spacing between the paragraphs you want a spacing for.

### `setspace` (Line Spacing)

The `setspace` package is for setting spacing between lines in your document. All that is required of the package is to insert the following into the preamble of your document.

```latex
\usepackage{setspace}
\doublespacing
```

### ` Geometry` (Margins)

Implement the following line to change the margins of your document.

```latex
\usepackage[margin=0.5in]{geometry}
```

### Advanced Columns (`multicol`)

For complex implementations of multiple columns, one can use the `multicol` package. For simple uses such as for implementation of 3 columns, just place the section within a `multicols` section as seen below.

```latex
\begin{multicols}{3}
	\blindtext
\end{multicols}
```
